= Introduction =

GeckoFX is a .NET wrapper around XULRunner 1.8, a runtime based on the same source
code as Firefox 2.x.  You can add the control to your windows forms app and use it much the same way as System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser.

Since GeckoFX is a wrapper, you need to already have XULRunner installed.  At the moment,
GeckoFX works best with XULRunner 1.8.1 (older versions haven't been tested, and 1.9 definately does NOT work).  You can download XULRunner 1.8.1 from:

	ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/xulrunner/releases/1.8.1.3/contrib/win32/

Then, in your application startup code, call:
{{{
Skybound.Gecko.Xpcom.Initialize(xulrunnerPath);
}}}
where "xulrunnerPath" is the full path to the location where you extracted the "xulrunner" directory (containing xul.dll, xpcom.dll, etc).

NOTE: There are some files included with XULRunner which GeckoFX doesn't need.  You may
safely delete them:
{{{
AccessibleMarshal.dll
dependentlibs.list
mozctl.dll
mozctlx.dll
java*.*
*.txt
*.exe
}}}
